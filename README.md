# Restic Plugin
zsh plugin for installing command completions

This plugin automatically installs [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic/)'s completions for you, and keeps them up to date as your restic version changes.

To use it, add `zsh-restic` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... zsh-restic)
```
